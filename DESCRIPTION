Description: This is a supplement package to the paper 'Multivariate Spatial
    Covariance Models: A Conditional Approach' by Cressie and Zammit-Mangion
    (2015, submitted). This package can be used for the construction of
    covariance matrices for bivariate processes modelled using the
    conditional approach. The covariance functions are assumed to be Matern
    (3/2) covariance functions whilst functionality is provided for
    constructing interaction matrices using the bisquare function as the
    interaction function. The accompanying vignettes may be used to replicate
    the studies found in the paper.

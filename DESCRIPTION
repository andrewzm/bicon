Description: This is a supplement package to the paper 'Multivariate Spatial
    Covariance Models: A Conditional Approach' by Noel Cressie and Andrew
    Zammit-Mangion (2015, submitted). This package can be used for the
    construction of covariance matrices for bivariate processes modelled using
    the conditional approach. The covariance functions are assumed to be Matern
    covariance functions whilst functionality is provided for constructing
    interaction matrices using the bisquare function as the interaction
    function. The accompanying vignettes may be used to replicate the data,
    code, and analysis found in the paper.

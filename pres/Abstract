    Causal spatial models
    ---------------------

    Multivariate geostatistics is based on modelling all covariances between
    all possible combinations of two or more variables and their locations
    in a continuously indexed domain. Multivariate
    spatial covariance models need to be built with some care, since any
    covariance matrix that is derived from such a model has to be
    nonnegative-definite. In this presentation I will talk about a specific
    class of multivariate spatial models that are constructed using conditional 
    dependency arguments:  causal spatial models. We show that these models yield flexible, 
    yet valid cross-covariance functions that generalize many of the special cases 
    used to date. The approach will be demonstrated on both simulation and 
    real case studies, one of which applies the model to flux estimation of methane 
    in the United Kingdom and Ireland. This is joint work with Noel Cressie.
